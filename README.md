# Carleton_CS_208

In this class I learned to write simple programs in both MIPS and PAL assembly languages, and compared these 2 languages in efficiency and design. I also learned about the organization and function of the basic components of computer hardware, from interactions between major components such as RAM with the CPU, to detailed descriptions of the logic circuits comprising each subcomponent of the basic datapath. - paraphrased from our Course Syllabus

This repository will include programming assignments from my Computer Organization and Architecture class. We programmed in PAL using a PDP8 simulator and in MIPS using MARS. We also used Logisim to create a simple version of the MIPS and PDP8 datapaths.

The following file extensions go with the following programs:

.circ goes with Logisim (can be installed at http://www.cburch.com/logisim/download.html)

.dat is used with Logisim to store data

.pal is used with the PDP8 (can be installed for Mac only at https://www.bernhard-baehr.de/pdp8e/pdp8e.html)

.asm is used with MARS (can be installed at http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/download.htm)
